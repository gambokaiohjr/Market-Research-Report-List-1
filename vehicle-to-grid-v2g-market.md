<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional V2G</li><li>Bidirectional V2G</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology allows electric vehicles (EVs) to interact with the power grid. In a unidirectional V2G market, energy flows only from the grid to the EVs for charging, with no return flow of energy. In contrast, a bidirectional V2G market enables the two-way exchange of energy, allowing EVs to supply stored energy back to the grid during peak demand, thus contributing to grid stabilization and renewable energy integration. Both markets enhance energy management and sustainability.</p></p>
