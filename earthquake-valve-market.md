<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Earthquake Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Motion Sensing Caged Ball</li><li>Excessive Flow Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The earthquake valve market includes two main types: motion sensing caged ball valves and excessive flow sensors. Motion sensing caged ball valves detect ground movement and automatically shut off gas or fluid flow to prevent leaks and explosions during seismic events. Excessive flow sensors, on the other hand, monitor the flow rate through pipelines and trigger shutdowns when abnormal conditions are detected. Both technologies enhance safety and infrastructure resilience against earthquakes, making them essential for risk management in vulnerable areas.</p></p>
