<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuro-Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Neuro-stimulators</li><li>Non-invasive Neuro-stimulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neuro-stimulators market is divided into two primary types: invasive and non-invasive neuro-stimulators. Invasive neuro-stimulators involve surgical implantation within the body, such as deep brain stimulators, used for conditions like Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. In contrast, non-invasive neuro-stimulators, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), are applied externally to stimulate neural activity without surgery, often used for pain management and depression treatment. Both types aim to modulate nerve function and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
