<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photovoltaic Rapid Shutdown Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Optimizer</li><li>Microinverter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Photovoltaic Rapid Shutdown Device market includes two primary types: Power Optimizers and Microinverters. Power Optimizers enhance the performance of solar panels by optimizing the power output of each module while maintaining safety during shutdown. They work with a string inverter to enable communication and monitoring. Microinverters, on the other hand, are installed on each solar panel and convert DC to AC power individually, improving efficiency and allowing for rapid shutdown in emergencies. Both technologies prioritize safety and reliability in solar installations.</p></p>
