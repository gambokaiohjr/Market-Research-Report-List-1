<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pitch Coke Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Raw Coke</li><li>Calcined Coke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pitch coke market is segmented into two main types: raw coke and calcined coke. Raw coke is produced directly from the carbonization of coal tar pitch and is primarily used as a fuel source or as a precursor for further processing. Calcined coke, on the other hand, is made by heating raw coke at high temperatures to remove volatile compounds, resulting in a dense product with high purity, mainly utilized in aluminum, carbon products, and electrodes manufacturing. Both types cater to distinct industrial applications.</p></p>
